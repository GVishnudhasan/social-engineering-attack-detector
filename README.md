## About The Project

The tool works by analyzing user profiles on social media platforms and identifying suspicious behavior such as fake identities, suspicious activity, and potential social engineering attacks. It then sends notifications to the concerned authorities in real-time via email, alerting them of any potential threats.

## Built With

The tool is built using Angular for the frontend and Flask for the backend. It uses the Firebase Cloud Messaging service to send notifications via email.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running npm install in the project root directory and pip install -r requirements.txt in the backend directory.
3. Set up a Firebase project and configure it with your email account. Follow the instructions provided by Firebase for setting up an email address for sending notifications.
4. Add your Firebase configuration details to the environment.ts file in the src/environments directory.
5. Run the backend server by running python app.py in the backend directory.
6. Run the frontend server by running ng serve in the project root directory.
7. Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:4200.

## Usage

To use the tool, simply enter the social media platform and user ID of the profile you want to analyze, and click the Report button. The tool will analyze the profile and display any suspicious activity detected, as well as sending an email alert to the concerned authorities if necessary.
